# Welcome to HariOm-Labs

Production-grade solutions for real DevOps and Platform Engineering challenges.

Built by an engineer, for engineers—no surface-level tutorials, just deep technical implementations that solve actual problems.

---

## Mission

To create production-ready, battle-tested solutions that address gaps in DevOps and Platform Engineering tooling. Each project is:

- **Production-grade** - Not toy examples or POCs
- **Deeply documented** - Exploring the "why" behind every decision
- **Focused** - One repository per problem statement
- **Practical** - Real-world considerations: security, scale, cost, reliability

---

## Current Status

**Just launched!** (October 2025)

HariOm-Labs is in its early days. I'm currently:
- Setting up the foundation and organizational structure
- Identifying high-impact problem statements to tackle
- Building initial solutions with comprehensive documentation

**Building in public** - Follow along as repositories go live!

---

## What Makes This Different

### Engineering Depth
Every solution includes architecture decisions, trade-off analysis, and lessons learned—not just "how to run it."

### Production Focus
Code is designed for real environments with considerations for:
- Security and compliance
- Scalability and performance
- Cost optimization
- Operational excellence
- Team collaboration

### One Problem, One Repo
Each repository tackles a specific challenge with laser focus, making solutions easy to understand, adopt, and contribute to.

---

## Focus Areas

Drawing from 9+ years of hands-on experience, HariOm-Labs solutions will cover:

### Infrastructure & Cloud
Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), hybrid and on-premises infrastructure (VMware), networking architectures, databases and storage systems

### Platform Engineering
Internal Developer Platforms (IDP), developer experience optimization, self-service tooling, golden path creation

### Kubernetes & Containers
Container orchestration, resource optimization, multi-cluster management, security hardening

### Automation & Delivery
CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm), release engineering, automation frameworks

### Observability & Reliability
Monitoring and alerting, SRE practices (SLIs/SLOs/SLAs), incident management, performance optimization

### Security & Compliance
DevSecOps integration, security automation, compliance frameworks, secrets management

### Cost & FinOps
Cloud cost optimization, resource right-sizing, cost attribution and chargeback, budget management

## What's Coming

I'm currently exploring problem statements across:

- **Infrastructure & Cloud**: Optimization, cost management, multi-cloud patterns
- **Kubernetes & Containers**: Resource management, security, operational excellence
- **Platform Engineering**: IDP foundations, developer experience, self-service
- **Automation**: CI/CD, GitOps, IaC patterns, release engineering
- **Observability**: Monitoring, SRE practices, incident management
- **Security**: DevSecOps, compliance automation, secrets management

**The first repositories will emerge organically as I identify problems worth solving deeply.**

Each project will be chosen based on:
✓ Real-world impact and frequency  
✓ Gaps in existing solutions  
✓ Production-readiness potential  
✓ Learning value for the community  

Follow this organization to see what problems surface first!

## Philosophy

> "The best way to learn deeply is to build something real, document every decision, and share it with others who face the same challenges."

HariOm-Labs exists because too many resources stop at the surface. We're building solutions that engineers can actually use in production, with all the messy details included.

**Stay tuned. First repositories dropping soon.** 🚀
